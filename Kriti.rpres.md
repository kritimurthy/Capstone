Introduction
========================================================


My text prediction application predicts and auto-completes your frequently used words and phrases. 

This makes typing faster, more intelligent and reduces effort. 

Data Sources
========================================================


This application was built on information sourced from US Blogs, US Tweets and US News. 

The source data can be found [here] (https://github.com/kritimurthy/CapstoneProject).

Algorithm
========================================================


This application uses the ngram algorithm to predict the next word for phrases with two, three or four words. 

ngram models are widely used in statistical NLP (Natural Language Processing). If the user entered phrase has one word, this application will predict the second word; if the phrase has two words, the application will predict the third and if the phrase has three words, the application will predict the fourth.
